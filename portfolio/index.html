						<h2><center>About Me!</center></h2>
						<center><img src="images/2-1622 (1).png" alt="Sharon" style="width:400px"></center>

					
					<p>Hi there! My name is Sharon Tran. I am currently studying at San Jose State University, hoping to attain a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art with a minor in Human Systems Integration. The art I create transpires into an exploration in evolution, human emotions, communication, and connection. I am very curious and passionate about implementing human-centric thinking into art and technology. Being a artist means that I always find ways to improve. Experimenting with abstract visual forms, patterns, and different ways to interact with art fuels my creativity. I hope to bring people closer together through more curiosity, more research in psychology, technology, and art.</p>

						<h2><center>Artist Statement</center></h2>
					
					<p>	My artwork explores the mindfulness and bright uplifting feelings that bring joy to others. Art is my outlet from all the craziness and stress I’ve experienced in my life. I put my feelings into each work I’ve created and loved each and every one of them. Art to me is a rollercoaster with tons of exciting adventures where I get to be inspired and let my mind roam around. Letting my mind think visually and express myself to art is one of the many reasons why I love it so much! I believe art should be something where others should express themselves.</p>
					<p>I value art with no limitation. I find it important to learn, understand, and utilize art because it allows people to see the world and beyond in a much wide range perspective. Along the way, I became curious about the process of human development and expression. To me, art is a way to express human emotions such as happiness, sadness, and nostalgia where I put my feelings into these art pieces. What I’ve learned is that anyone can make art by having the courage to explore the ‘what ifs’ and stretch the boundaries for endless possibilities. The human-centric aspects help mold the creative process in design, art, and technology. I hope to bring people closer together through more curiosity, more research in human-centric, art, and technology. As well as, delivering those feelings to my viewers, as I begin to develop stronger emotion and connection to my art.</p>
